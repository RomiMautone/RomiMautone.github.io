        <h3>JavaScript Fundamentals</h3>
<p>Welcome back to a new post about my learning journey.
    <br>
    On this occasion we are gonna discuss several other topics.
    <br>
    Let’s begin!
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>First things first, let’s talk about HTML and CSS.
        <br>
        <br>
        <a link href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">HTML</a> describes the structure of a Web Page therefore, it consists of inputting elements that will tell the browser how to display them.
        <br>
        On the other hand, <a link href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">CSS</a> works as a styling tool that can be applied to each of the HTML elements. CSS can alter font-names, colours, background -colors , positions and several other properties to make our website stand out.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>My personally analogy will be: 
            <br>
            <br>
            Let’s say that you just rented a house and you will need furniture for it.
            If you use HTML you will be having the basic furniture (elements) to be able to cook, rest and chill on your couch. These are the basic elements to have a functional house.
            Elseways, if you use CSS, you are able to enhance your house further. This is like acquiring plants, framed art, ect in order to “decorate” the house. You could even pick a certain couch colour so it will match your lounge wall colour. These properties are only decorative and have no real function as HTML does.
            </p>

            <img src="images/html_css_javascript_infographic.png" id="html-css-js"><br>
        <h3> Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</h3>
        <p>Let’s define them first:
            <br> <br>Control Flows is in computer science the order that the instructions, statements or functions are executed while some condition.
            <br>Looping facilitates the execution of a set of instructions, statements or functions repeatedly while some condition.
             <br> <br>
            This is an analogy of an everyday life activity to understand this concepts.
            <br> <br>Let’s say that our control flow function is:
            <br>
           <ul> 
               <li>If sunny, make a laundry washing</li>
            <li>Else if (cloudy), check the weather forecast</li>
           <li> Else (rainy) hold on to it.</li>
           </ul>
           <br>This means that if the day is sunny you will do the laundry. If cloudy, you should check the rain forecast for the day.
           <br>Otherwise, if it rains, there is no point in doing your laundry.
            </p>
            
            <p>Now, let’s take this example to a loop function.
                <br> On the loop function, you repeatedly execute the instructions(this means, make several laundry washings throughout the day) until you reach one of the ‘else’ statements. On the loop function, you should have a starting point, and an exit criteria so that it won’t loop indefinitely. In this example it will be until it is too late in the day to keep doing the laundry.
                </p>
                <br>
        <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. </h3>
        <p>DOM stands for  Document Object Model. This is the way that Javascipt interacts with our HTML file.
            <br> 
            <br>The way that DOM can be used is by manipulating HTML element's, this means creating, deleting, modifying among several other properties.
            <br>A simple example of this will be when you hover over a menu item on a website, and it displays a long list of items within it altering the background colour of  the element where our mouse is hovering.
            </p>
            <br>
        <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
        <p>The difference between arrays and objects is that in the array we can save multiple values in a single variable. This means that the information is stored in a linear statement and the order of the values does matter. 
            <br> <br> This is a great property to be used when there is a connection between the values.
            <br>To be able to access these values, we need to know the exact location of the item.
            <br> <br><span id="bold-letter">Note:</span> the order of the elements in programming starts counting from 0, instead of 1 as we humans count.
            <br>This is an example of places that I have visited in the order I did so:
            </p>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/array-countries.png" class="centered-img">
            <p>On the other hand, when using data objects, there is no need to know the exact location of the value. We can access these values by just calling them. Also, we can store characteristics for each value.
                <br> This is an example of countries that I have visited, where the order doesn’t matter but their characteristics do:
                </p>
            <br>
                <img src="./images/object-countries-example.png" class="centered-img">
                <br><h3> Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
        <p>Functions are a block of code designed to perform a particular task or calculate a value. To do so, it needs to take an input in order to return an output.
            <br> Functions are awesome to reuse code. You will just need to set the arguments once and reuse it as many times as wished.
            <br>   
            Here is an example:
            </p>
            <img src="./images/function-example.png" class="centered-img">
            <p> 
                <span id="bold-letter">Note</span> that the function ‘multiply’ can be reused as many times as wished for any other values.
                  </p>
        
                <p>I hope this is helpful on your programming journey.
                    <br>

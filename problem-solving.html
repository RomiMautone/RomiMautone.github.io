        <p class="small-letter">Problem solving - Friday 16th July 2021</p>
    <h3>JavaScript problem solving techniques</h3>
    <br>
        <h2>
            This is a brief story about my learning journey and how I dealt with an issue that arose along the way.
        </h2>
        <br>
        
        <p>
            I was trying to resolve some exercises from my course curriculum, when I encountered a problem that was not that simple to resolve. What I needed to resolve was finding out the average score of 4 different values given for every student on the list. 
       </p>
        <p>
            As I had been advised throughout the course about how to approach problems, I first did an analysis of the bigger picture. 
            <br>“What am I really trying to accomplish here?”. Once I did this, I then decided to start breaking the problem down into pieces, therefore, I wrote pseudocode as a guide. 
            <br>Pseudocode is written in plain english and basically you figure out every step needed in order to reach the result. 

        </p> 
        <p>
            A great analogy to this will be baking a cake. You want to do the steps in the right order so you will be able to achieve the desired result. 
            <br>Example, what temperature your oven needs to be, do you mix the dry ingredients first or the wet ones,  how long does your cake take to be ready, ect.
        </p>
        <p>Another example used daily: </p>
        <br>
        <img src="./images/pseudocode1.jpeg" class = 'centered-img'>
        <p>
            Once I wrote this, I needed to figure out the necessary ingredients and quantities to make this cake. So I started writing my code in small pieces and gathering all of the necessary elements. 
            <br>When I wasn’t sure how to achieve one of those steps, I decided to do some research online and find other people that encountered a similar situation or someone that has expertise in the area and has some learning lessons. 
            <br>There are several online resources, from articles, videos, online platforms that have exercises, among others.
        </p>

         <p>
                At this point my perspective changed from the first impression I had about the problem. At first, this challenge seemed impossible to accomplish but I ended up proving myself wrong. 
                <br>I started realizing that resolving this challenge on my own was doable if only taken the right approach.
         </p>
         <br>
         <h2>
                This is a reflection about the problem solving techniques applied.
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            I noticed that I feel confident using the pseudocode technique because breaking down the problem helps me analyze the necessary elements of code needed to achieve the result. Also, I do use google to learn further how to apply the properties or watch videos that explain so. 
            <br>Then I give it a go, and try modifying it if the error message finds some syntax. I also like console.logging to learn how the different pieces of the code interact.

        </p>
        <p>
            I find that I use the same techniques to approach the problems and this seems to work out so far. I am confident that I will be able to solve other challenges on my own since this past Sprint was a bit too challenging and I had to take a look into the proposed solutions to guide my thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep it up everyone,  
        </p>

        <p class="small-letter">Foundations reflection - Tuesday 27th July 2021</p>
        <h3>Foundations Reflection</h3>
        
        <p> 
            This is Sprint 5 reflections about my 5 weeks journey into Foundations.
            <br> Here are some questions I had to reflect upon:
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            <ul>
            <li> I have learnt about negative self-talk and how we can defeat it. </li>
            <li>I learnt that encountering challenges in a positive way is crucial in order to defeat them.</li>
            <li>I learnt about growth mindset vs fixed mindset and how I can modify my neural paths to create a better habit.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        </p>

        <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Everything. I love the idea of complementing our logical brain using our creative/intuitive side as well. 
            <br>This core content should be taught from an early age and in all sorts of studying environments. 
            <br>Struggles are part of our daily life and the information and tools presented here are highly beneficial for any individual.
        </p>
            <br>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h3>
        <br>
        <p> Learning about neuroplasticity and the research made by Carol Dweck. It was quite illuminating and empowering. 
            <br>Having to learn further about the subject really encouraged me to engage with this growth mindset.
        </p>
            <br>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p>There were a few questions, I believe that was during End-of-sprint 1 reflections, that the retrospective was very intense and I felt clueless of how to approach my reflections. 
            <br>At times it is difficult to find the answers within ourselves.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
            </h3>
         <br>
         <p>
            I feel that you are preparing our soft-skills for the real world. I think that being a programmer means being motivated, with a positive and growth mindset.
            <br> It also means being creative and able to work in a team and under different circumstances. 
            <br>This core program makes us understand the need for adaptation.

         </p>
           <br> 
         <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
         <br>
         <p>I do not feel that it was a waste of time at all. I am very happy with all of the curriculum in its tech and core subjects. </p>
         <br>
         
            
            <p>Thanks for reading,</p>

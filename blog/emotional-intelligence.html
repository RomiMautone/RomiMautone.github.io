        <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>

        <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to perceive our own emotions, evaluate them and control them in a way that will benefit us. It is also the capacity to relate to other people's emotions in a non judgemental way.
            I personally came into this subject a few years ago when I noticed that I am a HSPs . Being an active meditator for the last 10 years of my life has awakened some receptors within my person. 
           Working in the hospitality field, made me noticed that I was tunning in with customer’s emotions and it was hard to discern which emotions belong to me and which ones they don't. This was a very overwhelming feeling but fortunately in the last 2 years I have been working on this and I can say I am able to empathise and relate with people’s emotions without making them my own.
           </p>

           <h1>How is it different to IQ?</h1>
           <p>IQ comes from our left hand side of the brain in contrast to emotional intelligence that comes from our right hand side. IQ speaks about our logical thinking process that helps us to resolve problems. It is beneficial to sort out issues that have a set structure or goal.
            On the other hand, EQ speaks about the emotions within our bodies and the ability to interact and empathize with others. Please note the difference between <a link href="https://www.wellandgood.com/empath-vs-empathic/">empath and empathic.</a>  
            </p>
            <h1>Why is it important? </h1>
            <p>It is hugely important to interact as human beings but also, to understand our very own emotions. It is the access key to be able to introspect and become aware of our feelings. Emotions need to be controlled to a certain degree since letting them take over our mind and actions can be not in our benefit.
                Also, understanding that someone’s frustration or some negative emotion towards us, is not personal. We very often project into others our repressed emotions and needs as well as others do that to us. Being able to identify this projection and analyse it without criticism, it is highly beneficial in our life.

       <h2> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
<p>My long term goal is being able to live from this profession and develop my knowledge in a way that I can learn new technologies and languages to broaden my knowledge. I like the idea of working in an industry where I can grow as a professional since there is on-going information and tools in this area.</p>
<br>
<h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
<p>I believe that one of my strengths is being a naturally organised person as well as being resourceful. My attention to detail, sense of responsibility and good memory are also beneficial for my learning. In regards to my limitations, perfectionism will be the first one I believe. I could get caught up on a detail until I am happy with the result.</p>
<br>
<h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
<br>
<p>I would like to develop a good habit when it comes to balancing work and personal life. As well as balancing my right side of the brain with the left side. I believe EDA is a great educational influencer with their introspection tasks and yoga classes.</p>
<br>
<h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
<br>
<ol>
<li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
<li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
<li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
<li>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</li>
<li>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</li>
These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.
</ol>
<br>
<ol>
<br>
 <li>When it comes to work with facilitators or peers I will be respectful, open-minded, and a good listener. I feel that everyone has their right to express themselves whether we agree or not. Another key element is always communicating, because I believe this is the solution to avoid or resolve many issues.</li>
 <br>
 <li>If things start to get to me, I will first try to solve it on my own by committing more hours of my day and finding extra resources. I also find meditation a great stress reliever. If I can’t resolve it on my own, I will communicate with a facilitator to explain to them how I feel and release some of that pressure on me. Probably, I will also express my feelings to peers since there might be someone that can help me out or someone that is going through the same but doesn’t like speaking up.</li>
 <br>
 <li>As I expressed before, I believe I know my limits so I will communicate to a facilitator if I need help. I will commit more hours of my day since I am fully invested into this course, however bearing in mind not to overdo it, since  I need to be able to balance my personal life.</li>
 <br>
<li>I expect from the facilitation team, a supportive group that is able to help us when working on technical tasks but at the same time that challenges our knowledge. On the human-side, I expect the same support, understanding and respect.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Bootcamp learning plan</h1>
<br>
<h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
<br>
<p> 
  My long term goal is finding an IT job in which I can put my knowledge and analytical capabilities in use. 
  <br>I don’t have a specific place where I would like to work, I guess I will investigate when the time arises to see the company’s work environment and support.
  </p>
<br>
  <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
<br>
<p>
  My biggest strength will be staying focused and on top of the work. And my limitations probably will be giving myself breaks and releasing some tension and pressure I put on myself.
</p>
<br>
<h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
<br>
<p>
  I believe my biggest non-technical challenge will be speaking in front of an audience.
</p>
<br>
<h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
<br>
<p>
  I would like to see my reflective skills improve and find the right words to describe my feelings and thoughts. Also, I would like to feel more acceptant when it comes to receiving feedback.

</p>
<br>
<h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
<br>
<p>
  I saw the previous bootcamp group and  they were really united and supportive. I like the idea of working as a team and being able to express our concerns and doubts without feeling judged
</p>
<br>
<h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
<br>
<p>
  I consider myself a respectful person and I expect that from others. I want to stay open-minded and with a positive growth mindset to be able to learn as much as possible. 
  I will seek help as soon as needed, either with colleagues or facilitators. I believe that evacuating doubts right away is essential so we can keep ourselves focused to learn further.

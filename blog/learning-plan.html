       <h2> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
<p>My long term goal is being able to live from this profession and develop my knowledge in a way that I can learn new technologies and languages to broaden my knowledge. I like the idea of working in an industry where I can grow as a professional since there is on-going information and tools in this area.</p>
<br>
<h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
<p>I believe that one of my strengths is being a naturally organised person as well as being resourceful. My attention to detail, sense of responsibility and good memory are also beneficial for my learning. In regards to my limitations, perfectionism will be the first one I believe. I could get caught up on a detail until I am happy with the result.</p>
<br>
<h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
<br>
<p>I would like to develop a good habit when it comes to balancing work and personal life. As well as balancing my right hand side of the brain with the left side. I believe EDA is a great educational influencer with their introspection tasks and yoga classes.</p>
<br>
<h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
<br>
<ol>
<li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
<li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
<li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
<li>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</li>
<li>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</li>
These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.
</ol>
<br>
<ol>
<br>
 <li>When it comes to work with facilitators or peers I will be respectful, open-minded, and a good listener. I feel that everyone has their right to express themselves whether we agree or not. Another key element is always communicating, because I believe this is the solution to avoid or resolve many issues.</li>
 <br>
 <li>If things start to get to me, I will first try to solve it on my own by committing more hours of my day and finding extra resources. I also find meditation a great stress reliever. If I can’t resolve it on my own, I will communicate with a facilitator to explain to them how I feel and release some of that pressure on me. Probably, I will also express my feelings to peers since there might be someone that can help me out or someone that is going through the same but doesn’t like speaking up.</li>
 <br>
 <li>As I expressed before, I believe I know my limits so I will communicate to a facilitator if I need help. I will commit more hours of my day since I am fully invested into this course, however bearing in mind not to overdo it, since  I need to be able to balance my personal life.</li>
 <br>
<li>I expect from the facilitation team, a supportive group that is able to help us when working on technical tasks but at the same time that challenges our knowledge. On the human-side, I expect the same support, understanding and respect.</li>
</ol>

<li>I encountered a situation a while ago when one of my co-worker at the Cafe I used to manage would just serve free coffee to his friends. I understand that this person comes from a place that might think it is not a big issue to be serving coffee that has a minimum cost. 
    In addition, several times happens that a specific coffee was wrongly made as specified or because this was such a busy place that the same coffee will be made twice for the same order, and then will be poured down the drain.
    Although, I come from a place that believes that every single one of us has a job, therefore a paycheck and we know our limitations. When you go into a Cafe I would think that you intended to go with the purpose of paying for the consumption. Otherwise, you will refrain from attending places that are not on your budget.
    As a manager, I felt that it was my obligation to make my co-worker aware that there is a cost for making a coffee and that there is also wages to be paid to the Barista, the waiter that will deliver or clear that coffee cup, and the person that will then wash the cup afterwards. Coffees were personally made for their friends, they were not mistaken ones. 
    This all adds on to the fact that I am responsible to create the right and fair environment for everyone.
    My action was to warn him that he will need to pay for their friends' coffees if he continues to keep giving away coffees.
    The result was that he stopped doing so since he did not want to pay for this.

    <li> My culture has influenced the way I relate with people, the kind of language I use and how I behave. Where I come from,South America,  we have a very assertive and direct way of expressing ourselves. It might seem a bit confrontational at times to people that come from a different culture but I've been working on finding a middle ground.
    I truly believe that culture is the society identity and it is what either unites the community or it separates it. Feeling part of a community is to me a very important value, therefore I've been working on my values and beliefs to adjust to the new society I live in.

<h2>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h2>
<br>
<ol>
<li> Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</li>
<li>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</li>
<li>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</li>

</ol>
<br>
<ol>
<li>I would like to start talking about my strengths since I believe that positive things should have a greater impact than downfalls. I have been told on several occasions that I am a fast learner and a person who is able to grasp new concepts easily. I do believe that I am since I personally think that I have a very inquisitive mind that is always trying to search for further information and understand why things are that way.
    Also, I believe that creativity has always been a strength in my persona because since early childhood I have been developing my artistic side. This ability allows me to think outside of the box when it comes to solving problems or even to find different ways of studying and keeping myself motivated throughout the lessons. 
    Other strengths I would like to mention related to the learning process is my analytical thinking and my detail-oriented mindset.
    On the down side, I have had situations where I become frustrated for not being able to progress or understand a concept, therefore I could develop a pessimistic approach after several attempts. However, not being afraid to communicate and ask for support has helped me realize that everyone has been through similar experiences in the past and is all part of the learning process.
</li>
     <br>
<li>Probably I would say that the strength that will help me the most on my learning journey will be the fact that I am a resourceful person, who will try to find a solution on my own before giving up or asking for help. I believe that by trial and failure I learn the most since I am a kinesthetic person. My attention to detail and good memory are also beneficial for my learning

<li>There was a time, when I was a Manager at the Cafe mentioned earlier, and I started noticing things that could be improved. Such things were for example, rearranging the drinks fridge in a way that every drink will be displayed at the same time that it was easily reachable. Another example was stacking old orders of that same day, in a place that we could refer to if any issues arose during this day. 

    Many of the new organizational ideas I was propousing were not taken into account by the General Manager at the time, because she believed that the system that had been in place for years, was working. I explained to her my point of view, that many things were working but we did lack a few improvements in some areas. She resisted for a while to new changes until I started sharing my creative ideas with the other fellow managers and they also thought that the Cafe and our work would really benefit from improvements.
    I feel this strategy really worked at the time since changes were implemented and everyone involved was benefiting from them, even the General Manager who resisted.
    
    Probably I wouldn’t have taken a different approach now. I feel that communicating to whoever is the boss should be the very first thing. What I probably will do differently is come up with a plan or some written information about the changes and make it a more official thing for me, so I can express how committed I am to be in charge of the reorganisation.
    I do also understand that in many situations my creative ideas won’t be useful or provide any benefit, so I am flexible but also persistent if I truly believe in it.

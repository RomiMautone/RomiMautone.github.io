        <p class="small-letter">Neuroplasticity- Sunday 11th July 2021</p>
    <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Understanding  the principles of neuroplasticity are highly important and beneficial for every single one of us. 
            <br>As neuroplasticity research shows, human beings of any age are able to change, adapt and reorganize our brains. 
            <br>Our neurons are alive, therefore our brain is malleable. 
            <br>Explaining these principles, that we have the capacity to do so and we are fully in charge of our mental growth, encourages people to take a more active role in their learning process or recovery.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2>
           <br>
        <p>I had the opportunity to learn this powerful concept a while ago, I just wasn’t aware of its technical name. Also, I wasn’t familiar with the extent of this concept.
            <br>I have been working on something called “brain reprogramming” for self-improvement of my thoughts. Being in charge of our thoughts and how we perceive things and accept them or not, tell us a lot about our inner thinking.
           <br> Meditation is a great helper when reflecting over the realisations we encountered during that certain situation. This is where neuroplasticity tells us that we are able to achieve our highest potential, it is just a matter of believing in it.
            <br>I personally feel that I already implement several of the neuroplasticity principles on a daily basis in different areas of my life.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I feel that believing in it, believing that it is possible to alter our brain, that gives us motivation and the encouragement needed to start the action. 
                <br>I guess another factor is to use it, use it, and repeat until you feel confident in whatever it is you are trying to achieve.
                <br> By just trying it, there are certain brain connections already happening that activate the path, and by repeating it you just make that connection even stronger.</p>
                <br>
            <h2>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging. </h2>
            <p>This article from <a link href='https://www.britannica.com/science/neuroplasticity'> Britannica</a>
                is very well explained.</p>
                <br>
            <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Growth Mindset is knowing that we can actually learn new things and improve ourselves and our capacity. 
                <br>Growth mindset talks about seeing obstacles as challenges instead of a barrier as opposed to a “fix” mindset. 
                <br>Growth mindsets is the idea of expansion and feeling the need or desire to learn something.
                <br>It is extremely relevant to every single one of us, because without a growth mindset, we won’t be able to self-improve, learn new things in life, face our obstacles among many others challenges.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you? </h2>
                <br>
                <p>I feel like I heard many of these concepts before but it has been very beneficial  for me to have a reinforcement and understanding how it actually works. 
                <br>I feel that having to be exposed to this subject makes my mind crave to learn even more in life.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>This is a hard question, I have great hopes on this learning journey since enrolling into this course was activated for the desire to grow my capabilities.
                <br> I know I have the capacity to learn new things and this course is already a challenge that will make my brain connect with other parts of itself that it didn’t before. I probably will say that staying positive against obstacles will benefit me the most instead of seeing them as a barrier on this journey. 
                <br>Also, practicing and gaining confidence in the field will grow my mindset as said by James Clear in the Buffer article.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I actually found this resource from <a link href= 'https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/'>Brain Pickings</a> very helpful and then I realised it was one of the additional resources to this subject on the curriculum
                </p>
                <h2>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h2>
                <p>I think this amazing concept I just learnt will help me to be more patient and empathetic within myself instead of feeling frustrated when facing an obstacle.
                <br> It is a good reminder that everyone has a different learning process and times, however we are more than capable of achieving our goals with perseverance. 
                <br>Remaining positive and open-minded are also crucial to take full advantage of this process.</p>  
                <br>
                <p>I hope this inspires you in some way.
                    <br>
                    Thanks for reading,</p>
